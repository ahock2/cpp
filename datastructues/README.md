# Data Structures
In my CSC 1254 course (Intro to C++ II), I was taught how to use the node, stack, queue, and tree data structures. These are a few of
the homework assignments I completed for the course. The original header files that he had us use were created by my 
professor, Dennis Castleberry. The link to the original header files can be found here.
